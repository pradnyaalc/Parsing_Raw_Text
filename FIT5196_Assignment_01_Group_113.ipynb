    "This assignment focusses on analyzing text data and extracting meaningful information from the semi-structured text files. The dataset provided is a text file of size 17.4 MB whih contains the information in semi-structured xml format. The dataset contains the information about several grants given for IP patent claims.\n",
    "Each patent grant consists of different fields such as patent_title, citations_network, patents_kind, claims etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted data about the grants is to be converted into csv and json format.\n",
    "The data becomes structured on storing into these formats and hence, it becomes easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is divided into following tasks - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the data using regular expressions, convert it into CSV format and store the output in a CSV file.\n",
    "2. Extract the data using regular expressions, convert it to json format and store the output in a json file.\n",

Such media items or data content may include audio clips, movie clips, TV clips, and music videos, as well as content such as blogs, social media pages, short original videos, pictures, photos, articles, avatars, software programs, games, etc. Content hosting sites and social networking sites allow users to share media items or data content with other users as social shares (e.g., a feed item, post). The social shares can be presented to users in various feeds (e.g., social feed, news feed). A social share can include a reference to a media item or data content and typically includes its own set of comments that are specific to the social share.

      "<p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">Conventional content sharing services allow users to share media items with other users that result in the creation of social shares associated with the media items. A social share refers to content (e.g., post, feed item) resulting from a user sharing a media item (e.g., via a share request) via a social network or a content sharing service. A media item can be digital video, streaming video, an image, digital music, streaming music, a status update, a location of a user, etc. The content sharing service can present social shares to users in one or more feeds (e.g., social feeds, news feeds). The social shares can include references to media items (e.g., a URL that directs a viewing user to a hosted video). Conventionally, when multiple users share the same media item in different social shares, each social share is created as a different instance. Each social share instance typically includes its own set of comments. For example, user A can share a video in a post in a social network. Other users who are socially connected to user A can view the post, watch the video and add comments that are then included in user A's social share. User B can share the same video in a different post. Social contacts of user B can view user B's post, watch the video and add comments that are then included in user B's post. Each social share typically has a different set of comments so comments associated with user A's sharing of the video generally do not appear on the social share resulting from user B's sharing of the same video. Similarly, comments associated with user B's sharing of the video typically do not appear on the social share resulting from user A's sharing of the same video.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">Aspects of the present disclosure address the above deficiencies of conventional systems by providing global comments for a media item. Global comments are referred to herein to aggregated comments from different social shares, where the aggregated comments pertain to the same media item(s). In some implementations, a global comment service is provided that can identify a request for a media item to be shared, determine that the media item is to be presented with comments from multiple social shares, and obtain these comments for presentation to a user, as will be discussed in more detail below. At any time, the global comment service can receive a new comment posted by a user, and associate the new comment with the media item. Techniques described herein can provide one set of comments from any number of social shares associated with the same media item(s). The global comment service can be implemented as part of a content platform. Alternatively, the global comment service can be implemented as part of a social network platform that interfaces with a content platform. Yet alternatively, the global comment service can be implemented in a system that combines functionality of both the social network platform and the content platform.</p>\n",

The network <b>102</b> may be a private network (e.g., a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), intranet, etc.), a corporate network (e.g., a private network for an organization such as a corporation), a broadcast network, a public network (e.g., the Internet), a wired network (e.g., Ethernet network), a wireless network (e.g., an 802.11 network) and/or a cellular network (e.g., a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">The client/user device <b>104</b> may be any type of computing device, for example, a device including a processor, a computer-readable medium, and a memory. In some implementations, the client/user device <b>104</b> may be executing a browser application or other application adapted to communicate over Internet related protocols (e.g., TCP/IP and HTTP) and/or display a user interface. While only a single client/user device <b>104</b> is shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> may support a large number of concurrent sessions with many client/user devices <b>104</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">The content platform <b>110</b> and the social platform <b>116</b> each may include one or more computing devices that have a wide range of processing capabilities such a personal computer (PC), a server computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smart phone, a laptop computer, a netbook computer, a tablet device, and/or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions (sequential or otherwise) that specify actions to be taken by that machine.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">In implementations, the social platform <b>116</b> is part of the content platform <b>110</b>. In such implementations, the social platform <b>116</b> manages user interactions with content within the social platform <b>116</b>. Alternatively, the social platform <b>116</b> can be separate from the content platform <b>110</b>. In such implementations, when a user shares content of the content platform <b>110</b> on the social platform, the social platform <b>118</b> can interface with the content platform <b>110</b> to obtain global comments for the content.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">Data store <b>150</b> can include one or more writable persistent storage devices, such as memories, tapes or disks. Data store <b>150</b> can include one or more comments that are associated with a media item. The comments can be indexed and can be accessed using a key. In implementations, the key is an identifier of the media item (e.g., a unique ID).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">The content platform <b>110</b> can provide one or more shareable media items. To enable media item sharing, a media item manager <b>112</b> of the content platform <b>110</b> can associate a media item with a document (e.g., a web page) that can includes a sharable address (e.g., a uniform resource locator (URL). Users can share the URL with other users. When the other users access the URL, they can be directed to the media item.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">In implementations, the document can include metadata associated with the media item. For example, the metadata can include various information about the media item, such as a title, description, keywords, content type, width, height, a graphical representation associated with the media item (e.g., a thumbnail), an address, a username of an owner of the media item, a hashtag associated with the media item, an application name, one or more media item identifiers. The media item identifier can be an identifier for a page associated with the media item, such as a unique string identifier associated with the page (e.g., a canonical identifier, a canonical URL for the page, a non-canonical URL for the page). In some implementations, the media item identifier can be a channel identifier associated with the media item, and/or a playlist identifier associated with the media item. The metadata can also include a global comment indicator that indicates that the media item is to be presented with comments from multiple sources (e.g., multiple user devices).</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">In implementations, a canonical identifier for the page can be a base identifier or the minimum identifier that can be used to access the page. Additional strings can be added to the canonical identifier and still identify the page, but no shorter string can be used to identify the page. For example, a canonical URL for a page is: http://www.example.com/watch?PAGE_ID. A non-canonical URL (that includes the canonical URL) for the page can be used to access the page, such as http://www.example.com/watch?PAGE_ID/featureABC. In another example, a canonical identifier for a page is PAGE_ID and a non-canonical identifier for the page can be PAGE_ID&#x26;FEATURE_ID. Multiple unique identifiers can be associated with a page, such as an identifier for each media item loaded and/or played from the page, an identifier for a playlist that includes the media item, an identifier for a channel associated with the media item, etc. For example, a watch page that loads and plays a video has three unique string identifiers associated with it: 1) an identifier for the video loaded and played by the watch page (e.g., a video ID), 2) an identifier for a playlist associated with the identifier for the video (e.g., provides an identifier for the instance of the video in the playlist), and 3) an identifier for a channel that uploaded the video. In another example, a page for a playlist has a unique identifier for each media item in the playlist (e.g., video ID for each video in the playlist) and an identifier for the playlist (e.g., playlist ID). In implementations, the media item identifier is a hash of the media item. In implementations, the media item identifier can be encrypted.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">In some implementations, the social platform <b>116</b> includes a social share manager <b>118</b> to provide global comments for presentation to a user. In other implementations (not shown), social share manager <b>118</b> can be part of the content platform <b>110</b>. In yet other implementations, social share manager <b>118</b> can be part of the social platform <b>116</b> and can cooperate with the content platform <b>110</b> (media item manager <b>112</b>) to provide global comments for presentation to a user.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">The social share manager <b>118</b> can allow a user to submit a request to share a media item. For example, the social share manager <b>118</b> can provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that permits the user to input a media item share request. The request can include a URL of a page associated with the media item. The media item can be stored/managed by the content platform <b>110</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">In implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> may receive a request to share a media item. The request to share the media item can include an identifier for a page associated with the media item, such as a URL associated with the page. The page can be a watch page associated with the media item, a page for a playlist with multiple media items, a page that loads and plays or causes a player to load and play a media item, a page for a channel that is associated with one or more media items, a page for a channel that is associated with a media item, a social network page associated with a media item, a news website or article associated with a media item, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">After receiving a request to share a media item, the social share manager <b>118</b> can determine whether the media item is to be presented with comments from multiple social shares. For example, when multiple users post the same video on the social platform <b>116</b>, even when each post is created as a separate instance, comments from each of the posts can be aggregated between the posts. To determine whether the media item is associated with comments from different social shares, the social share manager <b>118</b> can obtain an identifier of the media item. The identifier of the media item can be unique to the media item and can be a canonical URL, as described herein. The social share manager <b>118</b> can obtain the media item identifier by accessing metadata associated with the media item. To access the metadata, the social share manager <b>118</b> can access the URL submitted by the user. The URL can be an address of a page that includes the metadata. For example, the media item identifier can be contained in a watch page document that is associated with the media item. The social share manager <b>118</b> can scrape the page to obtain the metadata and the media item identifier. The social share manager <b>118</b> can then use the media item identifier to search a comment data store (e.g., comment data store <b>150</b>) to obtain comments associated with the media item identifier. The comment data store can be managed by the content platform <b>110</b> or by the social platform <b>116</b>. For example, the data store <b>150</b> can be a database and the social share manager <b>118</b> can use the media item identifier as a key to identify comments associated with the media item. The social share manager <b>118</b> can obtain any identified comments from the comment data store <b>150</b>. Once the social share manager <b>118</b> obtains comments associated with the media item, the social share manager <b>118</b> can present the comments in association with the social share that includes the media item. For example, the social share manager <b>118</b> can present the social share and the comments via a comment area of a GUI of the client device <b>105</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">In implementations, when determining whether to present comments from other social shares with the media item, the social share manager <b>118</b> can parse the metadata of the media item to find a global comment indicator. Upon detecting the global comment indicator, the social share manager <b>118</b> can determine to present comments from other social shares with the media item.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">In some implementations, when determining whether to present comments from other social shares with the media item, the social share manager <b>118</b> can search the comment data store <b>150</b> using the media item identifier. When no comments are identified, the social share manager <b>118</b> can determine to not present comments from other social shares with the media item. When at least one comment is identified, the social share manager <b>118</b> can determine to present comments from other social shares with the media item.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">In some implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> can use additional factors when determining whether the media item is to be presented with comments from multiple social shares. Additional factors can include a time since last receiving a comment associated with the media item, a time that the media item was uploaded, a threshold amount of view, likes or shares for the media item, an amount of shares, views likes in a predetermined amount of time, etc. For example, the social share manager <b>118</b> may determine that a media item should not be presented with comments from multiple social shares when the media item was uploaded at a time that exceeds a threshold amount of time. In another example, the social share manager <b>118</b> may determine to present media item with comments from multiple social shares when the media item has been accessed or viewed more than a threshold number of times. In a further example, the social share manager <b>118</b> may determine to present media item with comments from multiple social shares when the media item has been accessed or viewed more than a threshold number of times within a predetermined amount of time.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">In implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> receives a new comment from a user device, which can receive the new comment via a comment area of a GUI. The social share manager <b>118</b> can associate the new comment with the identifier media item identifier. The social share manager <b>118</b> can submit the new comment to the comment data store <b>150</b> where it can be stored in association with the media item identifier. In implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> can present the new comment, such as in the comment area of the GUI of the client device <b>105</b>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">In some implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> can present the comments in a chat room. When determining whether to present comments from other social shares with the media item, the social share manager <b>118</b> can consider a current population of an existing chat room. For example the social share manager <b>118</b> may not present a chat room when the current population exceeds a threshold. The social share manager <b>118</b> may prioritize chat rooms with fewer users or chat rooms with recent user activity. The social share manager <b>118</b> may also prioritize chat rooms where a particular user is already present. Once the chat room is displayed to a user, the user may have access to additional controls to change which chat room to join. In some implementations, when a user adds a comment to a chat room, this may generate an automatic feed event or a social share. For example, the social share manager <b>118</b> can generate a new social share and presented the new social share in a feed of other users when a user adds a comment, which can encourage more users to join the chat room. In implementations, the new social share may exclude specific comments of the chat room and merely mention that the user &#x201c;commented on&#x201d; or &#x201c;chatted about&#x201d; a particular subject within the chat room.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">In implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> may not receive the media item identifier from metadata in a page associated with the media item. When the social share manager <b>118</b> does not obtain the media item identifier from the metadata, the social share manager <b>118</b> can derive the identifier of the media item by obtaining a page ID (e.g., from the metadata) that is associated with the media item and determining a base unique identifier that can be used to identify the media item. In one implementation, the social share manager <b>118</b> determines the base unique identifier by updating the page ID by removing portions of the page ID and accessing the page associated with the updated page ID. If the updated page ID accesses the same page, the social share manager <b>118</b> continues removing portions of the page ID until the page is not accessible using the updated page ID. Upon not being able to access the page with the updated page ID, the social share manager <b>118</b> can revert to the previous page ID that worked and determine that is the base unique identifier for the media item. For example, if the metadata can include a page ID http://www.example.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\\this_is_extra, the social share manager <b>118</b> removes the &#x201c;this_is_extra&#x201d; portion of the page ID and accesses the page. In this example, the page is accessible and social share manager <b>118</b> determines that http://www.example.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0 is the identifier of the media item.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">In implementations, the social share manager <b>118</b> can obtain the identifier of the media item by requesting the identifier of the media item from a content server (e.g., content platform <b>110</b>), from a data store, from a site associated with the social share, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">Although each of content platform <b>110</b>, social platform <b>116</b> and data store <b>150</b> are depicted in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> as single, disparate components, these components may be implemented together in a single device or networked in various combinations of multiple different devices that operate together. Examples of devices may include, but are not limited to, servers, mainframe computers, networked computers, process-based devices, and similar type of systems and devices. Implementations of the disclosure may operate within a single server device or on multiple server devices. Implementations of the disclosure may operate as a standalone system. In some implementations, the content platform <b>110</b> and the social platform <b>116</b> are managed by a single entity. In some implementations, the content platform <b>110</b> and the social platform <b>116</b> are managed by different entities.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users, or may make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether the content platform <b>110</b> collects user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location), or to control whether and/or how to receive content from the content platform <b>110</b> that may be more relevant to the user. In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by the content platform <b>110</b>.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">At block <b>204</b>, the processing logic determines whether the media item is to be presented with a plurality of comments from a plurality of social shares. The plurality of social shares can correspond to posts submitted on at least one of a social network site or a content hosting site. When determining whether the media item is to be presented with a plurality of comments from a plurality of social shares, the processing logic can obtain an identifier of the media item, as described in more detail conjunction with <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, the processing logic can search a data store (e.g., comment data store <b>150</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>) using the media item identifier to determine whether the data store contains comments associated with the identifier of the media item. In implementations, when determining whether the media item is to be presented with a plurality of comments from a plurality of social shares, the processing logic can parse metadata of the media item to find a global comment indicator. The global comment indicator can indicate that the media item should be presented with a plurality of comments from a plurality of social shares. The global comment identifier can also include a location (e.g., a URL of a data store) for where to obtain the comments from the plurality of social shares. At block <b>206</b>, the processing logic obtains the plurality of comments from a data store using a media item identifier for presentation to a user in response to a determination that the media item is to be presented with the plurality of comments from the plurality of social shares.</p>\n",

It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present disclosure.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">Some portions of the detailed description have been presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.
